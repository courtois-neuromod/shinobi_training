# Courtois-NeuroMod: [shinobi training subdataset](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/shinobi_training)

The [Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod)](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour.

Participants played the game *Shinobi III The Revenge Of The Ninja Master* at home to train prior the imaging study. A extensive description can be found [here](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DATASETS.html#shinobi_training).

This subdataset is organized as a behavior-only dataset following loosely the [brain imaging data structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (including extensions in development) and contains:
- [x] game play recording as bk2 files from OpenAI retro API. It consists of the emulator start state and button presses to replay gameplay.

*(unchecked are collected data which have not yet been integrated in the dataset)*

Courtois NeuroMod data are [freely shared with the scientific community](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/ACCESS.html) to advance research at the interface of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Access to to the data is based on a registered access model, see the Courtois NeuroMod website for more information. Redistribution of data outside of the Courtois NeuroMod data bank is prohibited.
